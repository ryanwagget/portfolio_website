            <h3>The Idea</h3>
            <p>I was tasked to create a typography video about myself but instead of making a video of text on a colored background, I decided to film my own content. This was really fun because I got to work with lighting, plan out the shots to tailor to the special effects, set up scenes, and created my own props. Everything in the video represents myself in one way or another. The language, music, and animations create a light hearted tone to show my personality. Each 'ingredient' also shows things that I personally like such as the color green, music, and taking pictures.</p>

          <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-6 columns">
            <h3>The Plan</h3>
            <p>For each 'ingredient', I decided I wanted them to be introduced where you would normally find them and then added to the mixture in a way that mimicked real food in a recipe. For example, the light bulb was found in a lamp but it was cracked open like an egg. I started off by creating a list of things that represent me and related them to a physical object. In the case of the lightbulb, it represented 'great ideas'. I then came up with how I would turn each object into a food that could be used in the recipe. After gathering all of the assets and planning everything out, I mixed different ingredients together and in different quanities to see how the mixture would look. For example, if I used water, it wouldn't really show up in the video that well so I decided to use milk. If I used too much milk, you would be unable to see the paint blob because the paint would sink to the botton.</p>

            <h3>Filming</h3>
            <p>Once everything was planned out, it was time to film. Lighting is something that really makes or breaks a video and it seperates the professional videos from the amateur ones. Unfortunately, I don't have any professional equipment so I had to rely on natural lighting. Here in London, Ontario, the the days go by pretty fast in the winter so to have similar, consistant lighting, I had to film everything between 1:00pm - 2:00pm. Because of this, I had to film on three different days and really plan out each scene and camera angles before hand. I also had to practice mixing the ingredients. I only had one take to add each ingredient into the bowl for the video to ensure that the mixture was consistent throughout the video.</p>

            <h3>Creating The Video</h3>
            <p>Once everything was filmed, I exported everything I needed into Adobe After Effects. To create the pace of the text on the screen, I said the text outloud and then added the text in with that speed and intervals between words, including slang I may have naturally used like 'er' instead of 'her'. I pieced the video together so that it resembled a typical cooking video you see on the internet. These videos are extremely popular and you see them all over social media. This helped create the idea of a recipe video but in the end, was more of a parody.</p>
