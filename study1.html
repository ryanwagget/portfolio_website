            <h3>The Idea</h3>
            <p>This is a video I created in Adobe After Effects as a promotional video for Melvin Gordon. Melvin Gordon is an NFL running back for the Los Angeles Chargers and one of his nicknames is 'Flash Gordon' because he's such a fast runner. Because of this and the fact that he personally enjoys comics and video games, I decided to put him inside of a comic book to show off his football highlights. This is very effective because it shows that he can run so fast, hit so hard, and literally fly over the other team so well that he must be a superhero instead of an ordinary player.</p>

            <h3>Creating the Comic</h3>
            <p>To create the comic, the first thing I did was to create 12 compositions of clips that I wanted to play in each panel of the comic. I then exported the first and last frame of each composition and then brought all of those into photoshop.</p>

          <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-6 columns">
            <p>Once in photoshop, I edited all of the pictures to look like they were panels in an old fashioned comic. I started off by changing the resolution of the each picture to 150 pixels per inch so that the small dots from the color halftone effects would be much smaller then they would be normally. After applying a color halfotne effect, I created another version of the original photo and applied a poster edged filter and blended both versions of the picture together. The poster edged filter reduces the variety of colours so that the entire image looks more like it was drawn for a real comic. Once I had done this with all 14 exported frames, I brought them into Adobe Illustrator. Inside of illustrator, I created a comic book with 12 panels, a header, and a footer. I filled all of the panels in with the photoshoped pictures. I also created a cover page for the comic as well as onamonapia text to animate in the video for later.</p>

          <div class="small-12 medium-6 large-6 columns">
            <h3>Creating the Video</h3>
            <p>To start off, I brought the comic book and cover page files into after effects. To navigate around the comic book between panels, I created a camera and made keyframes to move, tilt, and rotate both the camera as well as the comic to get the desired feel of motion. All of the compositions I created earlier were already timed to the music so at this point, all I had to do were the transitions between the panels. Lining up the compositions with the comic book was quite a pain but once I finished doing that, the end result looked very smooth. Once the transitions were done, I started adding the extra stuff.</p>

            <h3>The Extra Stuff</h3>
            <p>Something I believe that is very important within motion design is variety. Variety is crucial to keeping the viewer engaged, especially on the internet where you only have an average of 7 seconds to keep the viewer from clicking away from your video. To induce variety in this video, I implemented 3D elements as well as onamonapia text. Examples of this kind of text include words like 'Wooosh!' and 'BAM!'. This also helps in creating the comic book look and feel as this is very common to see in popular super hero comics. There are also some panels that show a comic version of Melvin Gordon moving before the video even starts. You can see this on the cover page and in panels 3 and 6. To do this, I cut out the 3D elements in photoshop and removed them in the original picture. I then brought both assets into After Effects where I then animated them.</p>
